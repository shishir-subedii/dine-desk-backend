Backend for restaurant management system. 

DineDesk (Restaurant Management System)
DineDesk is a SaaS-style restaurant management application built to streamline operations for restaurants of any size. It focuses on admin and staff workflows, with a clean dashboard and functional tools rather than unnecessary complexity. A single restaurant can manage multiple branches, making it suitable for small businesses or growing chains.

Core features include:

Admin Dashboard: Add/edit menus, manage orders, view analytics (sales, popular dishes, daily/weekly reports).

Staff Interface: Update order statuses (e.g., cooking, ready, delivered) in real time.

POS-Like Functionality: Place and track dine-in or takeaway orders.

Role-Based Access Control: Different permissions for admins and staff.

The tech stack mirrors CineAxis for consistency: NestJS for backend, Next.js with ShadCN for frontend, PostgreSQL (TypeORM or Prisma), and TypeScript throughout. The UI will be professional and brand-friendly, suitable to showcase on Upwork/Fiverr as a demo for potential clients. While not as complex as CineAxis, DineDesk will still look polished and practical, demonstrating the ability to build client-grade software with a strong user experience
